**Support tickets streamline the process of submitting queries and assigning staff members for each query. This provides a convenient system for organizing and managing inquiries in a more efficient way.**

## Sample Use Case

 1. Here's a sample flow with minimal configuration for using the ticketing system in Glific

![flow](https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/40158831/defba88d-21d3-414a-822c-0eed3754fe18)

___

2. The first node is the `Send Message` node, which prompts the contact to share his query so a new ticket can be opened

___

3. The second node is the `Wait for Response` node with the result name `ticket`. The response from the contact will be saved in this result and can be referenced as `@results.ticket`.

___

4. The third node is `Open ticket` node which is used to create a new ticket from flow
    1. Choose `Open a ticket with a human agent` from the dropdown in node action.
    1. There we can add the labels like `registration`, `help`, `activity` to help in streamlining open tickets based on labels
    1. Choose the appropriate `staff member` to resolve that query.
    1. At last is the ticket body, here we are using the `@results.ticket` from the previous step(step 1)

# View Support Ticket Inquiries

1. To view `support tickets`, navigate to the `Support Tickets` section by hovering over `Flows` in the left panel and selecting it. In this screen, you can see all the tickets, their status, and assigned staff members. Here's how the page would look like:
   
![support](https://github.com/glific/docs/assets/90472056/c787bd94-07a8-4111-8f49-cca6e6c1ee2f)

There are five columns in the Tickets screen namely:

`ISSUE:` Displays the posted queries.

`OPENED BY:` Indicates who opened the ticket.

`STATUS:` Shows whether the ticket is `open` or `closed`.

`ASSIGNED TO:` Specifies the staff member assigned to the ticket.

`ACTIONS:` Provides options to add remarks, change the assignee or status of the ticket.

___

Once a ticket is created, users can make edits by utilizing the `add remark` option. Additionally, they can close the ticket by providing a closing remark and setting the status as `closed`. These features allow for easy ticket management and efficient resolution.
