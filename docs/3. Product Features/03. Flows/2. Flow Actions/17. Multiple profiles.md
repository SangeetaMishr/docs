## Sample Use Case

To achieve multiple profiles feature, We added a new node called` Manage profile` with two choices to the flow level. `Switch Profile` allows you to change between profiles, while `Create Profile` creates a new profile for contact.


# Create Profile
1.  Here's a sample flow with minimal configuration for create profile in Glific

2. The initial node is the `Send Message` node, where the contact is prompted to provide their details such as name, role, or age to create the profile

3. The second node is the `Wait for Response` node with the result name `isername`. The response from the contact will be saved in this result and can be referenced as `@demo_username`.

5. Using the user information provided, the `Manage profile` node will create a user profile, and the relevant data will be saved in the result variables, accessible as `@results.demo_username` and `@results.demo_role` for future reference.
