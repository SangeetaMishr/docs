**Glific introduces multiple profiles feature, empowering NGOs to efficiently manage and personalize communication with beneficiaries sharing a single phone number, optimizing impact.**

___
## Sample Use Case

To achieve multiple profiles feature, We added a new node called` Manage profile` with two choices to the flow level. `Switch Profile` allows you to change between profiles, while `Create Profile` creates a new profile for contact.

___

# Create Profile

1.  Here's a sample flow with minimal configuration for create profile in Glific


___


2. The initial node is the `Send Message` node, where the contact is prompted to provide their details such as name, role, or age to create the profile


___

3. The second node is the `Wait for Response` node with the result name `isername`. The response from the contact will be saved in this result and can be referenced as `@demo_username`.


___

4. The third node is the `Interactive Message`, the user is presented with options to select their role, which can be either student, parent, or teacher.


___

5. Using the user information provided, the `Manage profile` node will create a user profile, and the relevant data will be saved in the result variables, accessible as `@results.demo_username` and `@results.demo_role` for future reference.



___

6. Finally in the `Update Contact` node, will update the contact with the relevel contact variables.


___

7. Upon profile creation, a message will be sent using the `Send Message` node, notifying you that "your user profile has been successfully created!"


___

# Switch Profile

1.  Here's a sample flow with minimal configuration for switch Profile profile in Glific



___

2. The first node is the `Send Message` facilitates users in switching between different profiles by using the `@contact.list_profiles` to display all available user profiles.


___

3.  The second node is the `Wait for Response` node where each profile will be numbered based on when they were created, first, second, third and so on. The response from the contact will be saved in the result and can be referenced as `@profile_index`


___


4. In this we'll use `Manage Profile` node to switch the user profile based on their response, using `@results.profile_index`.


___

5. After a successful switch, a message will be sent through the `Send Message` node, stating that "your profile has been successfully switched to @contact.fields.demo_username."
