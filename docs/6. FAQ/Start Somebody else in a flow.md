## Start Somebody else in a flow

Use the Start somebody else in a flow action to start a separate contact or collection in a flow when a contact reaches this step.

This feature enables whatsapp to whatsapp chatbot flow triggers. For example:  A teacher could use whatsapp to start a quiz or activity chatbot flow for multiple students, or a field worker could receive a whatsapp alert when a beneficiary has a query or concern.
