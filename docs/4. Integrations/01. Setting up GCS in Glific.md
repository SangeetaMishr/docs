Currently, Glific is using Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for various purposes including as a place to store data for reporting  via BigQuery   as well as to store media files.

You can use media file storage for both:

- To save the files received from contacts in the user responses.
- To send the saved files to contacts in a chat flow.

Below is the step by step flow to setup GCS in Glific.
