**ChatGPT is enhancing Glific by providing advanced conversational capabilities, improving communication and engagement with beneficiaries.**

## Using ChatGPT within Glific.

**Step 1 :** Import the below sample flow from the Flow screen and click on `setting` icon to configure it.

**Sample Flow**

[Write to Google Sheet.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glific/docs/main/docs/3.%20Flows/3.%20Flow%20Features/write_to_sheet.json)

**Step 2:** Click on `Flows` from the left panel and click on the setting icon to configure flow. Here's how the imported flow would look like

**Step 3 :** The first node is the `Send Message` node, which prompts contact to ask question which will then be sent to ChatGPT using `Call Webhook` in `Step 6`

**Step 4 :** The second node is the `Wait for Response` node with the result name `gpt_query`. The response from the contact will be saved in this result and can be referenced as `@results.gpt_query`.

**Step 5 :** The third node is the `Send Message` which we are sending to contact while we are sending user query to ChatGPT and waiting for the response.

**Step 6 :** Next in `Call Webhook` node we are calling [Jugalbandi](https://www.jugalbandi.ai/) APIs by choosing `FUNCTION` in node and adding value as `jugalbandi`

The function is then called with three key-value pairs as function body
`url:` urld depends on which model we use to process response as Jugalbandi offers GPT3.5, GPT4, Langchain, and GPTindex
`uuid_number:` uuid number from uploading
`query_string:` user query asked in flow

Additionally, you can use [Google sheet](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/Flows/Flow%20Actions/Link%20Google%20Sheets/) feature to store response as this data will later can be analyzed to evaluate each model's accuracy and effectiveness and help you make a decision.

Using the [webhook logs](https://cc.tides.coloredcow.com/webhook-logs), you can view the logs of questions asked and responses received by ChatGPT.

**Step 7 :** In the last step, the user is provided with their answer using the variable `@results.jugalbandi.answer`. This variable contains the response generated by the Jugalbandi API and is used to present the answer to the user.
