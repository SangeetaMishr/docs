**ChatGPT is enhancing Glific by providing advanced conversational capabilities, improving communication and engagement with beneficiaries.**

## Using ChatGPT within Glific.

**Step 1 :** Import the below sample flow  from the Flow screen and click on `setting` icon to configure it.

**Sample Flow**

[Write to Google Sheet.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glific/docs/main/docs/3.%20Flows/3.%20Flow%20Features/write_to_sheet.json)

**Step 2 :** When a contact arrives at this step in the flow, they will encounter the specific set of actions or messages that have been designed and programmed for that particular stage of the interaction.

**Step 3 :** In this step, the system waits for the contact to respond, and their input is stored in the variable `gpt_query`. This allows for further processing and utilization of the contact's response.

**Detailed info**

[Wait for response](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/Flows/Flow%20Actions/Wait%20for%20the%20contact%20to%20respond)

**Step 3 :** The "Wait for Time" flow action is used to send a message, such as "We received your query and are searching for the best answer. Hold tight!" to inform the user that their query is being processed by chatGPT, with an estimated response time of up to 15 seconds.

**Step 4 :** `Webhook calls` in Glific enable communication with third-party apps for automated handling of WhatsApp events. NGOs can receive and process contact responses, trigger actions, and utilize webhook response data within flows.

With the integration of ChatGPT into Glific using the [Jugalbandi](https://www.jugalbandi.ai/) APIs, Jugalbandi offers a variety of querying options, including GPT3.5, GPT4, Langchain, and GPTindex. As each model has its unique strengths, we had to make a decision and select the most suitable one.

 Glificâ€™s  [Google sheet](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/Flows/Flow%20Actions/Link%20Google%20Sheets/) feature. This allows to involve a larger group in the testing process, while simultaneously capturing and saving every query asked and response received in a linked Google sheet. This data will later be analyzed to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of each model and help us in making a decision

In the [webhook logs](https://cc.tides.coloredcow.com/webhook-logs), you can view the logs of searches and responses generated by ChatGPT. This provides visibility into the queries made to the model and the corresponding answers it produces during interactions.

**Step 5 :** In the last step, the user is provided with their answer using the variable `@results.jugalbandi.answer`. This variable contains the response generated by the Jugalbandi API and is utilized to present the answer back to the user. By referencing this variable, the system can seamlessly deliver the response to the user within the flow.
