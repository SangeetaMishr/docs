**ChatGPT is enhancing Glific by providing advanced conversational capabilities, improving communication and engagement with beneficiaries.**

## Using ChatGPT within Glific.

**Step 1 :** Import the below sample flow from the Flow screen and click on `setting` icon to configure it.

**Sample Flow**

[Write to Google Sheet.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glific/docs/main/docs/3.%20Flows/3.%20Flow%20Features/write_to_sheet.json)

**Step 2:** Click on `Flows` from the left panel and click on the setting icon to configure flow. Here's how the imported flow would look like

**Step 3 :** The first node is the `Send Message` node, which prompts contact to ask question which will then be sent to ChatGPT using `Call Webhook` in `Step 6`

**Step 4 :** The second node is the `Wait for Response` node with the result name `gpt_query`. The response from the contact will be saved in this result and can be referenced as `@results.gpt_query`.

**Step 5 :** The "Wait for Time" flow action is used to send a message informing the user that their query is being processed by chatGPT, with an estimated response time of up to 15 seconds.

**Step 6 :** `Webhook calls` in Glific enable communication with third-party apps for automated handling of WhatsApp events. NGOs can receive and process contact responses, trigger actions, and utilize webhook response data within flows.

With the integration of ChatGPT into Glific using the [Jugalbandi](https://www.jugalbandi.ai/) APIs, Jugalbandi offers a variety of querying options, including GPT3.5, GPT4, Langchain, and GPTindex. As each model has its unique strengths, we had to make a decision and select the most suitable one.

you can use [Google sheet](https://glific.github.io/docs/docs/Product%20Features/Flows/Flow%20Actions/Link%20Google%20Sheets/) feature. where you can upload data, this data will later be analyzed to evaluate each model's accuracy and effectiveness and help us make a decision.

Using the [webhook logs](https://cc.tides.coloredcow.com/webhook-logs), you can view the logs of searches and responses generated by ChatGPT.

**Step 7 :** In the last step, the user is provided with their answer using the variable `@results.jugalbandi.answer`. This variable contains the response generated by the Jugalbandi API and is used to present the answer to the user.
