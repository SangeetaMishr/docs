Some Glific steps with screenshots for your reference.

1. Call Webhook in a node.
    1. Choose to `Call a webhook` in the dropdown in node action.
    1. Choose `POST` in response type.
    1. Enter the `URL` where you want a Webhook connection.
    1. Click on the `Post Body` tab.
    1. Enter the variables which you want to pass through the webhook.

# Use webhook response in the flows. 

1. Let&#39;s say you make a webhook call (by using the above steps) and you want to use the response variable in the flow.

For example, if you send a response like a below object

```
{
"success_message" : "You are onboarded.",
"status_code": 200
}
```

> Please note that your webhook should always return a JSON object (not an array). 

Then you can use that response as **@results.mywebhook.success_message** Or if you want to use any other variable then it will be **@results.mywebhook.*YOUR_RESPONSE_OBJECT_KEY**

Here my webhook is a custom name you defined on your webhook node and **success_message**  is the key of the response object you send back in a webhook call.
