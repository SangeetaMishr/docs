15 . **Wait for result** - This node is used to get results from webhook results. If there is a delay in the response from webhook, then it will wait to get the result according to the time set in `wait for result.` Earlier, the flow used to break if there was a delay in the response from the webhook. But now, it will not break and will wait for the result from the webhook. Resume flow API is used to make this feature, which will queue the request. If there is no webhook, then `wait for result` will work as `wait for time`
