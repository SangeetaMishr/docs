## Send media file with dynamic file names

**Note** - _It will require a developers assistance to use this feature. Please check with your tech team or consult Glific team, if you wish to use this feature._

**Use case** :- `Expression` option is used in attachment, when there is a requirement to send media files with dynamic names.

For an example: The requirement is to send the map on the basis of the city contact belongs to.

1 . Upload map files of all cities in the GCS.

2 . Use the expression to pass the contact&#39;s city name in the attachment .

Syntax- `<%= "@results.city_name" %>.`

3 . In a flow, city map will be send as per the contact&#39;s city

Use `Expression` option from the dropdown, if media files name are needed to send with dynamic name.
