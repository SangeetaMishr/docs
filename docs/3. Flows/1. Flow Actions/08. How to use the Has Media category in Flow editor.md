You can use `Has Media` in your flow editor to receive and store media files in Glific. You can also receive the caption of the media file from the flow.

Create a variable to store the media file received from the contact. For example `picture`

Now you can save or use the media file URL received and its caption.

In this example, the syntax will be.

- for media file URL `@results.picture.url`
- for media file caption `@results.picture.caption`
