**Split By Random Chance** is used in flows when we want to test different user journeys/experiences against each other. This could be a registration process, a video, an informative image, a quiz, etc.

In the below example, we are testing the effectiveness of different "Introduction to Glific" videos against each other and checking which one leads to the most positive responses from users. 

Lets say there are 3 videos we want to test against each other:

1. Create the flow with the Split by random chance node and add a separate video in each bucket/branch, label each video sent.
2. Ask the user if they want to learn more after sending them the video.
3. Add labels for the positive responses. (and for negative responses, if relevant for your analysis)
4. Analyse the data to see which video is performing best and make the changes to your default flow.

So here, at the end of the test, we will measure how many users got each video, and then how many users wanted to know more after watching a given video. The video with the highest success rate (#Recieved video/#Wanted to know more) is the video we will likely use in the future. 

We may additionally choose to investigate with our sampled users, whether they watched the video or not and their reasons for giving a positive response before making our final decision.
